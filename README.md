 assignment 3

From Jexi:
To see this website, you need to first follow the installation guide on three.js website.

[Here's the link to the installation guide](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation)

I followed the Option 2: Import from a CDN in this guide.

After this step, you should be able to access the website I've created.

To create this simple website, I followed the guide for [Creating a scene](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)

I get the rotatin cube to work but hide it in my later development, if you want to see that, simply  take "//" out of this line of code: 

//scene.add(cube);

And you should be able to see the rotating cube. 

What I did was using a simple 3D model I built before and upload it to the website, and I added the code to achieve simple interactions for the user.

User can scroll to zoom in and out. Use click and drag to rotate the model.
